This project is a Snake Game built with Python using the Pygame library. 
The idea is simple: you control a snake that moves around the screen, and your goal is to make it eat the apple to grow bigger and increase your score.
If the snake hits the wall or itself, the game restarts automatically. 
The code is structured to handle keyboard inputs, move the snake, draw the snake and apple, and check for collisions.
The game runs in a loop that updates movement and rendering at a fixed speed.
